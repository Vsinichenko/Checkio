# As the input you'll get a chemicalformulaand a numberlimit. Your task is to create a sequence of chemical elements, which are in the amount of>= limitin the formula.
# 
# Pay attention, that in some formulas brackets(), []will be used. They have different meaning in chemistry, but from the point of calculating number of atoms they both work the same way - as ordinary parenthesis in mathematical expression.This articlewill help you to open the brackets and don't make mistakes while counting.

# Input:Chemical formula as string(str)and the limit number of atoms as integer(int).

# Output:Listof certain chemical elements, sorted in the alphabetical order.

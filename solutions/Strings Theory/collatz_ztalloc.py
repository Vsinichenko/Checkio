# TheCollatz conjectureis one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. However, the Collatz sequence can also be viewed in a binary fashion depending on whether each value stepsup(3x+1) ordown(x/2)  from the previous value, denoting these steps with"u", "d", respectively. For example, starting from n=12 here is the sequence and step shape:
# 
# 
# 
# Depending of thedatatype, you function must return the starting value (if string shape of letters"u", "d"is given) or shape of steps (if value is given).
# 
# This function must also recognize that some shape strings are impossible as entailed by the Collatz transition rules, and correctly returnNonefor all such shapes. You should start from the goal state 1, and perform  the given  transitions in reverse. Along  the way, you have  to ensure that your function does not accept moves that would be illegal in the original forward-going Collatz sequence.

#!/home/valentyna-sinichenko/miniconda3/envs/checkio/bin/checkio --domain=py run boundary-blocks

# This mission is like a subset ofVisibilities.
# 
# You are given a list of strings as grid.Empty cells will be represented by '.', and the blocks - by 'X'.Blocks are not adjacent to each other vertically and horizontally.
# 
# One area consists of empty cells that are adjacent to each other vertically and horizontally.You must return the coordinates of the blocks that make the boundary.
# 
# Input:A list of strings.
# 
# Output:An iterable of tuples of two integers (In row, column order).
# 
# Preconditions:3 ≤ len(grid) ≤ 203 ≤ len(grid[0]) ≤ 20all(set(row) <= {'.', 'X'} for row in grid)
#
